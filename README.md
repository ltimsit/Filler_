# Filler_
42 Filler project 


This project is a little AI game where the goal is to fill the maximum space on a board with randomly generated piece while preventing your opponent to do so.

Each piece is formed of a random number of block attached to each other in a random formation:
Exemples:
<pre>
.**
.*.
***
.**

.***...
.*.....
**.....

..**
</pre>
Each piece must overlap with only one of your previously placed piece block.
The Map can be any size you just have to define starting positions.

You then have to create the most ingenious and tactical strategy to beat the players we had to compete with.

My strategy is very agressive, I try to place my piece around the opponent as fast as possible to render it unable to play.

Show match vs SuperJeanot in my displayer. The Displayer take a webcam picture during compilation and add it as its background (Capital to the project! No im kidding but it help to catch off-guard our correctors :p)
